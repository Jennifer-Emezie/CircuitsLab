**Lab 3 – Introduction to DE10-Lite and Quartus Prime Lite**

• Program the Max 10 FPGA chip on the DE10-Lite board with your design;<br>
• Explore and test your decoder design;<br>
• Analyse the propagation delay of the decoder circuit<br>

**Lab 4 – Sequential circuits in SystemVerilog**

• how to design different types of counters and timers;<br>
• how to predict the maximum operating clock frequency of your clocked circuits;<br>
• how to design some useful timing and counting components for later Laboratory Sessions<br>
• how to generate pseudo-random binary sequence using a linear feedback shift<br>
register.

**Lab 5 – DAC and Function Generator**

• how to convert a digital value to a PWM signal, use a lowpass filter to turn the PWM signal into an analogue voltage, the SPI interface signals through ModelSim simulation,<br>
• how to use SPI interface to send serial digital data to a DAC device,<br>
• how to generate a triangular signal,<br>
• how to control the frequency of the triangular signal.<br>
