In this Labs 


Lab 3 – Introduction to DE10-Lite and Quartus Prime Lite

• Program the Max 10 FPGA chip on the DE10-Lite board with your design;
• Explore and test your decoder design;
• Analyse the propagation delay of the decoder circuit

Lab 4 – Sequential circuits in SystemVerilog

• how to design different types of counters and timers;
• how to predict the maximum operating clock frequency of your clocked circuits;
• how to design some useful timing and counting components for later Laboratory
Sessions
• how to generate pseudo-random binary sequence using a linear feedback shift
register.

Lab 5 – DAC and Function Generator

• how to convert a digital value to a PWM signal,
• use a lowpass filter to turn the PWM signal into an analogue voltage,
• the SPI interface signals through ModelSim simulation,
• how to use SPI interface to send serial digital data to a DAC device,
• how to generate a triangular signal,
• how to control the frequency of the triangular signal.
